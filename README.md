# 🛡️ Phishing Email Detector - Cybersecurity Tool

## ⚙️ Overview

This is a lightweight, interactive web-based phishing email detector designed to help users identify common phishing tactics in suspicious emails. The tool analyzes email content **line by line** and detects:

- Urgent or threatening language
- Suspicious/malicious links
- Spoofed domains (like "Amaz0n", "Paypa1", etc.)
- Generic greetings
- Other red flags based on phishing behavior

This project is built for educational and awareness purposes as part of a cybersecurity internship task.
